As I began working from home in sweats and maintaining most of my daily activities within walking distance, I’ve suddenly found myself with an influx of free time (as may a lot of you have) that I turned my attention to a tall stack of long ago purchased, unopened books on my shelf. Turns out that I was keen enough to pick out a varied list of fun and inspirational books but never ended up reading them, for problems with motivation and procrastination that may be. Reading has proved to be a wonderful way to steer through this difficult time as most of us are stuck at home, feeling powerless in the face of a depressing news cycle. Here, I am writing this post to share some insightful ideas and notes that I have picked up from my quarantine reading times.

### *Personal History* by Katharine Graham

Personal History is an autobiography by former Washington Post president and publisher Katharine Graham. Once titled one of the most powerful women in the United States, Graham took over the newspaper after the death of her husband, Phil Graham, and presided during some of the company’s most controversial times, including publishing of the Pentagon Papers and later the Watergate Scandal. In her book, Katharine Graham recalled the struggles of transitioning from the role of a housewife to the CEO of a mid-sized newspaper company at the time. She later described the experience as “...put one foot in front of the other, shut my eyes, and step off the edge. The surprise was that I landed on my feet.” Picking up from Ms. Graham, I outlined a few simple yet important lessons that are applicable to myself as well as many other young professionals in the business world. 


##### ✨ Know your weaknesses ✨

Stare your weaknesses directly in the face. As the old saying reminds us that “it’s not what happens to us, but how we react to it”. We need not be afraid of admitting to our mistakes or lack of knowledge, because not knowing gives us an opportunity to learn. Graham’s memoir recounts her growth from fear and intimidation to building one of America’s leading newspapers. She has stumbled and was under great stress because of her lack of knowledge in the business world, but how she managed to turn her insecurities into motivation has served a great lesson for me. When we continuously seek to learn, we eventually become better equipped with knowledge, which serves as our greatest leverage. In the end, who doesn’t want to navigate through the world with grace and poise? 


##### ✨ Build your network ✨

An introvert by nature, I was extremely uncomfortable in social circumstances and generally regarded the “desire to please” in a negative fashion, partly excused by the new millennial “be yourself” type slogan. Now, learning to be yourself is a beautiful thing, but my resolve to approach it by placing blame on my innate quality is not. I was essentially ashamed of my own tendency of wanting to please. The prime example that Ms. Graham has shown me in her memoir was to embrace that part of my character and put that to use especially in social circumstances. For her, “it was better to be talking to people who hated us or disapproved of us than not - and that good old-fashioned encumbrance of mine, the desire to please.” Here, Graham was referring to maintaining good relations with people who had openly bashed her or the company during the Watergate scandal. The amicable relationships we form will become a part of our asset, an advantage which I’m sure has been proven many times (like in The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell). 


##### ✨ Recognize your strengths ✨

Knowing your weaknesses is not to say we should dwell on them, because part of knowing ourselves includes knowing what you are good at. Sometimes, what we view as insignificant accomplishments may have a large impact. For example, a witty email might brighten up a client’s day, or an additional proofread might save our team from a major error. Recognizing what we did well boosts our self confidence and gives us the motivation to be even better. As evident throughout her book, Graham possessed the great quality of empathy and excelled in writing. From early on, she had formed a habit of answering letters from readers which helped in shaping the reputation of her company, for she believed that, “we in the media are all ombudsmen, trying to lessen the feeling some people have that they are helpless and without hope of a hearing.” 

##### ✨ Know your core values and what you want ✨

One of the reputations about the Post that Katharine Graham had taken great pride in since her husband’s time was publishing an impartial paper. She believed that the essence of journalism was to inform the public what’s true and had worked to maintain that value throughout the years, while withstanding great pressure from the Nixon administration on publishing the Watergate scandal. We may sometimes be intimidated by the not-so-great things accompanying adulthood, our senses numbed by mundane works, and our judgment altered by the blow of reality that crushed our dreams. The question to ask is: how do we persevere in maintaining things that we truly value. It’s an ongoing practice for all of us to get to know ourselves first so that we can focus on the things we truly want and eliminate distractions that are keeping us from attaining them.
